# Right-Here-Academy-Searching-Website
Open source website codes.
As you can see, this website is written by a Chinese student from SJTU as a course project. 
At first, I knew little about the website creating, the html, javascript and css codes. As time goes by, this website and my coding ability are becoming better and better. Thanks for my teachers and classmates.
I'd also like to thank for templatemo.com which gives me some tempolate to refer. Here I recommend this website to you and I'd like to share my codes with you.(My codes still need to progress, if you find some bugs, please tell me.)
